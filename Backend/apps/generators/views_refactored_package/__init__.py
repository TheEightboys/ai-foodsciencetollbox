# Views package for generators
# This package contains refactored views with centralized error handling
# To use the refactored views, update urls.py to import from this package

# Currently, URLs import from ../views.py (the original views)
# When ready to migrate, uncomment the imports below:

# from .refactored import (
#     LessonStarterGenerateView,
#     LearningObjectivesGenerateView,
#     DiscussionQuestionsGenerateView,
#     QuizGenerateView,
#     ContentListView,
#     ContentDetailView,
#     ToggleFavoriteView,
#     DeleteContentView,
# )
